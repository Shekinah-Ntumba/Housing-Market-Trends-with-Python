🏘️ Housing Market Trends Analysis (Python version)

This project replicates the “Analyzing Housing Market Trends in R” tutorial — using the same dataset logic — but implemented in Python. It performs data loading, exploration, and visualization to mirror the examples in the R tutorial.

🧠 Project Overview

We reconstruct the same dataset defined in the original R tutorial, which includes:

Date (monthly from Jan 2010 to Dec 2020)

MedianPrice (cumulative random walk + baseline)

SalesVolume (cumulative random fluctuations + baseline)

InterestRate, NumberOfListings, MedianDaysOnMarket, MedianSquareFeet, MedianPricePerSqFt

Region (categorical: North, South, East, West)

Using Python libraries, we replicate the visualizations and analyses to gain insights into housing market behavior.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

pandas

NumPy

matplotlib

seaborn

📊 Visualizations & Analyses

We replicate the following charts (as in the R tutorial):

Median Price Over Time — line chart

Scatter: Median Price vs Sales Volume — possibly colored by region

Histogram of Sales Volume

Donut Chart: Sales Volume by Region

Area Chart: Sales Volume over time, stacked by Region

(Optional) Waterfall Chart example

(Optional) More exploratory analysis: correlations, trend decomposition, etc.

💡 Insights & Comparisons

Because the dataset is synthetic (same as the R version), the insights will be illustrative rather than real. Still:

You’ll see how prices and volumes evolve over time with realistic fluctuations.

The region-wise breakdown shows how different regions contribute to sales volume.

Scatter relationships may show moderate correlation between sales volume and median price.

The visualizations allow you to compare with the original R outputs side by side.

⚙️ System Setup & Execution

Requirements

Python ≥ 3.8

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Install via:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Running

Use a Jupyter notebook or .py script.

Run the cell / script that loads the dataset and then the visualization sections.

The charts will render inline (in notebooks) or pop up (in scripts / GUI backends).

📈 Outcome & Extensions

By mirroring the R tutorial in Python, this project:

Demonstrates equivalence between R and Python for data analysis

Serves as a learning tool to translate techniques across languages

Provides a base for extensions: use real housing data, forecast prices, build dashboards (Dash, Streamlit, etc.)

Future improvements may include adding time-series decomposition (e.g. with statsmodels), forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet), regression modeling, or converting into an interactive dashboard.
